As of May 13th, this is my most interesting project, in which I:
Firstly, further solidified my knowledge in HTML, CSS, and JS.
Learned new coding methods such as factory functions and the module pattern.
Faced the challenge that this project was asynchronous (moves are made sequentially, etc.), and I had to grasp the topic of Promises in JavaScript.

Functionality:
- Various design solutions, such as loading animation or indicating the turn order.
- 4 game modes: AIvAI, Player v AI, AI v Player, Player v Player.
- Ability to choose name, icon, and so on (remember to click select for both players).
- Option to start a new game and reset scores.
- Return to the main menu (banner on the left when announcing the game result).
